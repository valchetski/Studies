Federal Information Processing Standards Publications (FIPS PUBS)
are issued by the National Institute of Standards and Technology after
approval by the Secretary of Commerce pursuant to Section 111(d) of the
Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended by the
Computer Security Act of 1987, Public Law 100-235.</h5>
<p>
<b>Name of Standard:</B> Digital Signature Standard (DSS).
<br><br>
<b>Category of Standard:</B> Computer Security; Cryptography.
<br><br>
<b>Explanation:</B> This Standard specifies a Digital Signature Algorithm
(DSA) appropriate for applications requiring a digital rather than
written signature.  The DSA digital signature is a pair of large
numbers represented in a computer as strings of binary digits.  The
digital signature is computed using a set of rules (i.e., the DSA)
and a set of parameters such that the identity of the signatory and
integrity of the data can be verified.  The DSA provides the
capability to generate and verify signatures.  Signature generation
makes use of a private key to generate a digital signature. 
Signature verification makes use of a public key which corresponds
to, but is not the same as, the private key.  Each user possesses a
private and public key pair.  Public keys are assumed to be known to
the public in general.  Private keys are never shared.  Anyone can
verify the signature of a user by employing that user's public key. 
Signature generation can be performed only by the possessor of the
user's private key.
<br><br>
A hash function is used in the signature generation process to
obtain a condensed version of data, called a message digest (see
Figure 1).  The message digest is then input to the DSA to generate
the digital signature.  The digital signature is sent to the
intended verifier along with the signed data (often called the
message).  The verifier of the message and signature verifies the
signature by using the sender's public key.  The same hash function
must also be used in the verification process.  The hash function is
specified in a separate standard, the Secure Hash Standard (SHS),
FIPS 180.  Similar procedures may be used to generate and verify
signatures for stored as well as transmitted data.

<b>Approving Authority:</B> Secretary of Commerce.
<br><br>
<b>Maintenance Agency:</B> U.S. Department of Commerce, National
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Computer Systems Laboratory
(CSL).
<br><br>
<b>Applicability:</B> This standard is applicable to all Federal
departments and agencies for the protection of unclassified
information that is not subject to section 2315 of Title 10, United
States Code, or section 3502(2) of Title 44, United States Code. 
This standard shall be used in designing and implementing public-key
based signature systems which Federal departments and agencies
operate or which are operated for them under contract.  Adoption and
use of this standard is available to private and commercial
organizations.
<br><br>
<b>Applications:</B> The DSA authenticates the integrity of the signed data
and the identity of the signatory.  The DSA may also be used in
proving to a third party that data was actually signed by the
generator of the signature.  The DSA is intended for use in
electronic mail, electronic funds transfer, electronic data
interchange, software distribution, data storage, and other
applications which require data integrity assurance and data origin
authentication.<br><br>

<b>Implementations:</B> The DSA may be implemented in software,
firmware, hardware, or any combination thereof.  NIST is developing a
validation program to test implementations for conformance to this
standard.  Information about the planned validation program can be
obtained from the National Institute of Standards and Technology,
Computer Systems Laboratory, Attn: DSS Validation, Gaithersburg, MD
20899.
<br><br>
<b>Export Control:</B> Implementations of this standard are subject to
Federal Government export controls as specified in Title 15, Code of
Federal Regulations, Parts 768 through 799.  Exporters are advised
to contact the Department of Commerce, Bureau of Export
Administration for more information.
<br><br>
<b>Patents:</B> The Department of Commerce is not aware of any patents
that would be infringed by this standard.
<br><br>
<b>Implementation Schedule:</B> This standard becomes effective
December
1, 1994.

<b>Qualifications:</B> The security of a digital signature system is
dependent on maintaining the secrecy of users' private keys.  Users
must therefore guard against the unauthorized acquisition of their
private keys.  While it is the intent of this standard to specify
general security requirements for generating digital signatures,
conformance to this standard does not assure that a particular
implementation is secure.  The responsible authority in each agency
or department shall assure that an overall implementation provides
an acceptable level of security.  This standard will be reviewed
every five years in order to assess its adequacy.
<br><br>
<b>Waiver Procedure:</B> Under certain exceptional circumstances, the
heads of Federal departments and agencies may approve waivers to Federal
Information Processing Standards (FIPS).  The head of such agency
may redelegate such authority only to a senior official designated
pursuant to section 3506(b) of Title 44, United States Code.  Waiver
shall be granted only when:
<dl>
<dd>a. Compliance with a standard would adversely affect the
accomplishment of the mission of an operator of a Federal
computer system; or
<br><br>
<dd>b. Compliance with a standard would cause a major adverse
financial impact on the operator  which is not offset by
Government-wide savings.
</DL>
Agency heads may act upon a written waiver request containing the
information detailed above.  Agency heads may also act without a
written waiver request when they determine that conditions for
meeting the standard cannot be met.  Agency heads may approve
waivers only by a written decision which explains the basis on which
the agency head made with required finding(s).  A copy of each
decision, with procurement sensitive or classified portions clearly
identified, shall be sent to: National Institute of Standards and
Technology; ATTN: FIPS Waiver Decisions, Technology Building, Room
B-154, Gaithersburg, MD 20899.
<br><br>
In addition, notice of each waiver granted and each delegation of
authority to approve waivers shall be sent promptly to the Committee
on Government Operations of the House of Representatives and the
Committee on Government Affairs of the Senate and shall be published
promptly in the Federal Register.
<br><br>
When the determination on a waiver applies to the procurement of
equipment and/or services, a notice of the waiver determination must
be published in the Commerce Business Daily as a part of the notice
of solicitation for offers of an acquisition or, if the waiver
determination is made after that notice is published, by amendment
to such notice.
<br><br>
A copy of the waiver, any supporting documents, the document
approving the waiver and any accompanying documents, with such
deletions as the agency is authorized and decides to make under 5
United States Code Section 552(b), shall be part of the procurement
documentation and retained by the agency.

<p>
<b> 1. INTRODUCTION</B>
<br><br>
This publication prescribes the Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA)
for digital signature generation and verification.  Additional
information is provided in Appendices 1 through 5. 
<br><br>
<b>2. GENERAL</B>
<br><br>
When a message is received, the recipient may desire to verify that
the message has not been altered in transit.  Furthermore, the
recipient may wish to be certain of the originator's identity.  Both
of these services can be provided by the DSA.  A digital signature
is an electronic analogue of a written signature in that the digital
signature can be used in proving to the recipient or a third party
that the message was, in fact, signed by the originator.  Digital
signatures may also be generated for stored data and programs so
that the integrity of the data and programs may be verified at any
later time.
<br><br>
This publication prescribes the DSA for digital signature generation
and verification.  In addition, the criteria for the public and
private keys required by the algorithm are provided.
<br><br>
<b>3. USE OF THE DSA ALGORITHM</B>
<br><br>
The DSA is used by a signatory to generate a digital signature on
data and by a verifier to verify the authenticity of the signature. 
Each signatory has a public and private key.  The private key is
used in the signature generation process and the public key is used
in the signature verification process.  For both signature
generation and verification, the data which is referred to as a
message, M, is reduced by means of the Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA)
specified in FIPS YY. An adversary, who does not know the private
key of the signatory, cannot generate the correct signature of the
signatory.  In other words, signatures cannot be forged.  However,
by using the signatory's public key, anyone can verify a correctly
signed message. 
<br><br> 
A means of associating public and private key pairs to the
corresponding users is required.  That is, there must be a binding
of a user's identity and the user's public key. This binding may be
certified by a mutually trusted party.  For example, a certifying
authority could sign credentials containing a user's public key and
identity to form a certificate.  Systems for certifying credentials
and distributing certificates are beyond the scope of this standard.
NIST intends to publish separate document(s) on certifying
credentials and distributing certificates.
<br><br>
<b>4. DSA PARAMETERS</B>
<br><br>
The DSA makes use of the following parameters:
<dl>
<dd>1. p = a prime modulus, where 2<sup><font size=1>L-1</font></sup> <
p
< 2<sup><font size=1>L</font></sup> for 512 = &lt L = <1024 and L a
multiple of 64<br><br>
<dd>2. q = a prime divisor of p - 1, where 2<sup><font
size=1>159</font></sup> < q < 2<sup><font size=1>160</font></sup>
<br><br>
<dd>3. g = h<sup><font size=1>(p-1)/q</font></sup> mod p, where
h is any integer with 1 < h < p - 1 such that h<sup><font
size=1>(p-1)/q</font></sup> mod p > 1<br>
(g has order q mod p)<br><br>
<dd>4. x = a randomly or pseudorandomly generated integer with 0 < x
< q<br><br>
<dd>5. y = g<sup><font size=1>x</font></sup> mod p
<br><br>
<dd>6. k = a randomly or pseudorandomly generated integer with 0 < k
< q
</DL>
The integers p, q, and g can be public and can be common to a group
of users.  A user's private and public keys are x and y,
respectively.  They are normally fixed for a period of time. 
Parameters x and k are used for signature generation only, and must
be kept secret.  Parameter k must be regenerated for each signature.
<br><br>
Parameters p and q shall be generated as specified in Appendix 2, or
using other FIPS approved security methods.  Parameters x and k
shall be generated as specified in Appendix 3, or using other FIPS
approved security methods.
<br><br>
<b>5. SIGNATURE GENERATION</B><br><br>

The signature of a message M is the pair of numbers r and s computed
according to the equations below:<br>
<dl>
<dd>r = (g<sup><font size=1>k</font></sup> mod p) mod q    and
<br><br>
<dd>s = (k<sup><font size=1>-1</font></sup>(SHA(M) + xr)) mod q.
</DL>
In the above, k<sup><font size=1>-1</font></sup> is the multiplicative
inverse
of k, mod q; i.e., (k<sup><font size=1>-1</font></sup> k) mod q = 1 and 0 <
k<sup><font size=1>-1</font></sup> < q.  The value of SHA(M) is a 160-bit
string output by the Secure Hash Algorithm specified in FIPS 180. 
For use in computing s, this string must be converted to an integer. 
The conversion rule is given in Appendix 2.2.
<br><br>
As an option, one may wish to check if r = 0 or s = 0.  If either r
= 0 or s = 0, a new value of k should be generated and the signature
should be recalculated (it is extremely unlikely that r = 0 or s =
0 if signatures are generated properly).
<br><br>
The signature is transmitted along with the message to the verifier.
<br><br>
<b>6. SIGNATURE VERIFICATION</B>
<br><br>
Prior to verifying the signature in a signed message, p, q and g
plus the sender's public key and identity are made available to the
verifier in an authenticated manner.
<br><br>
Let M', r' and s' be the received versions of M, r, and s, respectively, and let y
be the public key of the signatory.  To verifier first checks to see that 0 < r' < q
and 0 < s' < q; if either condition is violated the signature shall be rejected.  If
these two conditions are satisfied, the verifier computes
<br><dl>
<dd>w = (s')<sup><font size=1>-1</font></sup> mod q
<br><br>
<dd>u1 = ((SHA(M')w) mod q
<br><br> 
<dd>u2 = ((r')w) mod q
<br><br> 
<dd>v  = (((g)<sup><font size=1>ul</font></sup> (y)<sup><font
size=1>u2</font></sup>) mod p) mod q.
<br></DL>
If v = r', then the signature is verified and the verifier can have high
confidence that the received message was sent by the party holding the secret
key x corresponding to y.  For a proof that v = r' when M' = M, r' = r, and s' =
s, see Appendix1.
<br><br>
If v does not equal r', then the message may have been modified, the
message may have been incorrectly signed by the signatory, or the
message may have been signed by an impostor.  The message should be
considered invalid.
<br><br>
<center><b>APPENDIX 1. A PROOF THAT v =
r'</B></CENTER>
<p>
This appendix is for informational purposes only and is not required to meet
the standard.
<p>
The purpose of this appendix is to show that if M' = M,
r' = r and s' = s in the signature verification then v =
r'. We need the following easy result.
<p>
<b>LEMMA</B>.  Let p and q be primes so that q divides p - 1, h a positive
integer less than p, and g = h<sup><font size=1>(p-1)/q</font></sup> mod p.
Then g<sup><font size=1>q</font></sup> mod p = 1, and if m mod q = n mod
q, then g<sup><font size=1>m</font></sup> mod p = g<sup><font
size=1>n</font></sup> mod p.
<p>
Proof:  We have
<p>
  g<sup><font size=1>q</font></sup> mod p = (h<sup><font size=1>(p-
1)/q</font></sup> mod p)q mod p
<dl>
<dd>= h<sup><font size=1>(p-1)</font></sup> mod p 
<br><br>
<dd>= 1
</DL>
by Fermat's Little Theorem.  Now let m mod q = n mod q, i.e., m = n + kq for
some integer k. Then
<p>
   g<sup><font size=1>m</font></sup> mod p    = g<sup><font
size=1>n+kq</font></sup> mod p 
<dl>
<dd>= (g<sup><font size=1>n</font></sup> g<sup><font
size=1>kq</font></sup>) mod p
  <br><br>                
<dd>= ((g<sup><font size=1>n</font></sup> mod p) (g<sup><font
size=1>q</font></sup> mod p)<sup><font size=1>k</font></sup>) mod p
 <br><br>                 
<dd>= g<sup><font size=1>n</font></sup> mod p
</DL>
since g<sup><font size=1>q</font></sup> mod p = 1. 
<p>
We are now ready to prove the main result.
<p>
<b>THEOREM</B>.  If M' = M, r' = r, and
s' = s in the signature verification, then v = r'.
<p>
Proof:  We have
<dl>
<dd>w = (s')-1 mod q = s<sup><font size=1>-1</font></sup> mod
q
<br><br>
<dd>u1 = ((SHA(M'))w) mod q = ((SHA(M))w) mod q
<br><br>
<dd>u2 = ((r')w) mod q = (rw) mod q.
</DL>
Now y = g<sup><font size=1>x</font></sup> mod p, so that by the lemma,
<dl>
<dd>v = ((g<sup><font size=1>u1</font></sup> y<sup><font
size=1>u2</font></sup>) mod p) mod q
<br><br>
<dd>= ((g<sup><font size=1>SHA(M)w</font></sup> y<sup><font
size=1>rw</font></sup>) mod p) mod q
<br><br>
<dd>= ((g<sup><font size=1>SHA(M)w</font></sup> g<sup><font
size=1>xrw</font></sup>) mod p) mod q
 <br><br>    
<dd>= ((g<sup><font size=1>(SHA(M)+xr)w</font></sup>) mod p) mod q.
</DL>
Also
<dl>
<dd>s = (k<sup><font size=1>-1</font></sup>(SHA(M) + xr)) mod q.
</DL>
Hence

<dl>
<dd>w = (k(SHA(M) + xr)<sup><font size=1>-1</font></sup>) mod q
<br><br>
<dd>(SHA(M) + xr)w mod q = k mod q.
</DL>
Thus by the lemma,
<dl>
<dd>v = (g<sup><font size=1>k</font></sup> mod p) mod q
<br><br>
<dd>= r 
<br><br>
<dd>= r'. 
</DL>

<center><b>APPENDIX 2. GENERATION OF PRIMES FOR THE
DSA</B></CENTER>
<p>
This appendix includes algorithms for generating the primes p and q used in
the DSA.  These algorithms require a random number generator (see
Appendix 3), and an efficient modular exponentiation algorithm.  Generation
of p and q shall be performed as specified in this appendix, or using other
FIPS approved security methods.
<p>
<center><b>2.1. A PROBABILISTIC PRIMALITY TEST</B></CENTER>
<p>
In order to generate the primes p and q, a primality test is required.  
<p>
There are several fast probabilistic algorithms available.  The following
algorithm is a simplified version of a procedure due to M.O. Rabin, based in
part on ideas of Gary L. Miller.  [See Knuth, The Art of Computer
Programming, Vol. 2, Addison-Wesley, 1981, Algorithm P, page 379.]  If this
algorithm is iterated n times, it will produce a false prime with probability no
greater than 1/4<sup><font size=1>n</font></sup>.  Therefore, n > or = to 50
will give an acceptable probability of
error.  To test whether an integer is prime:
<dl>
<dd>Step 1. Set i = 1 and n > or = to 50.
<br><br>
<dd>Step 2. Set w = the integer to be tested, w = 1 + 2<sup><font
size=1>a</font></sup>m, where m is odd and 2<sup><font
size=1>a</font></sup> is the largest  power of 2 dividing w - 1.
<br><br>
<dd>Step 3. Generate a random integer b in the range 1 < b < w.
<br><br>
<dd>Step 4. Set j = 0 and z = b<sup><font size=1>m</font></sup> mod w.
<br><br>
<dd>Step 5. If j = 0 and z = 1, or if z = w - 1, go to step 9.
<br><br>
<dd>Step 6. If j > 0 and z = 1, go to step 8.
<br><br>
<dd>Step 7. j = j + 1. If j < a, set z = z<sup><font size=1>2</font></sup> mod
w and go to step 5.
<br><br>
<dd>Step 8. w is not prime.  Stop.
<br><br>
   Step 9. If i < n, set i = i + 1 and go to step 3.  Otherwise, w is probably prime.
</DL>
<b><center>2.2. GENERATION OF PRIMES</B></CENTER>
<p>
The DSS requires two primes, p and q, satisfying the following three
conditions:
<dl>
<dd>a. 2<sup><font size=1>159</font></sup> < q < 2<sup><font
size=1>160</font></sup>
<br><br>
<dd>b. 2<sup><font size=1>L-1</font></sup> < p < 2<sup><font
size=1>L</font></sup> for a specified L, where L = 512 + 64j for some 0 < or
=
to j < or = to  8
<br><br>
<dd>c. q divides p - 1.
</DL>
This prime generation scheme starts by using the SHA and a user supplied
SEED to construct a prime, q, in the range 2<sup><font
size=1>159</font></sup> < q < 2<sup><font size=1>160</font></sup>.  Once
this is accomplished, the same SEED value is used to construct an X in the
range 2<sup><font size=1>L-1</font></sup> < X < 2<sup><font
size=1>L</font></sup>.  The prime, p, is then formed by rounding X to a
number congruent to 1 mod 2q as described below.
<p>
An integer x in the range 0 < or = to  x < 2<sup><font size=1>g</font></sup>
may be converted to a g-long sequence of
bits by using its binary expansion as shown below:
<dl>
<dd>x = x<sub><font size=1>1</font></sub>*2<sup><font
size=1>g-1</font></sup> + x<sub><font size=1>2</font></sub>*2<sup><font
size=1>g-2</font></sup> + ... + x<sub><font size=1>g-1</font></sub>*2 +
x<sub><font size=1>g</font></sub> -> { x<sub><font
size=1>1</font></sub>,...,x<sub><font size=1>g</font></sub> }.
</DL>
Conversely, a g-long sequence of bits { x1,...,xg } is converted to an integer by
the rule
<dl>
<dd>{ x<sub><font size=1>1</font></sub>,...,x<sub><font
size=1>g</font></sub> } -> x<sub><font size=1>1</font></sub>*2<sup><font
size=1>g-1</font></sup> + x<sub><font size=1>2</font></sub>*2<sup><font
size=1>g-2</font></sup> + ... + x<sub><font size=1>g-1</font></sub>*2 +
x<sub><font size=1>g</font></sub>.
</DL>
Note that the first bit of a sequence corresponds to the most significant bit of
the corresponding integer and the last bit to the least significant bit.
<p>
Let L - 1 = n*160 + b, where both b and n are integers and 0 < or = to b < 160.
<dl>
<dd>Step 1.  Choose an arbitrary sequence of at least 160 bits and call it
SEED. Let g be the length of SEED in bits.
<br><br>
<dd>Step 2.  Compute
</DL>
<center>U = SHA[SEED] XOR SHA[(SEED+1) mod 2<sup><font
size=1>g</font></sup> ].</CENTER>
<dl>
<dd>Step 3.  Form q from U by setting the most significant bit (the
2<sup><font size=1>159</font></sup> bit) and the least significant bit to 1. In
terms of boolean operations, q = U OR
2<sup><font size=1>159</font></sup> OR 1. Note that 2<sup><font
size=1>159</font></sup> < q < 2<sup><font size=1>160</font></sup>.
<br><br>
<dd>Step 4.  Use a robust primality testing algorithm to test whether q is
prime<sup><font size=1>12</font></sup>(1).
<br><br>
<dd>Step 5.  If q is not prime, go to step 1.
<br><br>

<center><b>APPENDIX 3. RANDOM NUMBER GENERATION FOR THE
DSA</B></CENTER>
<p>
Any implementation of the DSA requires the ability to generate random or
pseudorandom integers.  Such numbers are used to derive a user's private
key,
x, and a user's per message secret number, k.  These randomly or
pseudorandomly generated integers are selected to be between 0 and the 160-
bit prime q (as specified in the standard).  They shall be generated by the
techniques given in this appendix, or using other FIPS approved security
methods.
<p>   
One FIPS approved pseudorandom integer generator is supplied in Appendix
C of ANSI X9.17, "Financial Institution Key Management (Wholesale)." 
<p>
Other pseudorandom integer generators are given in this appendix.  These
permit generation of pseudorandom values of x and k for use in the DSA.  The
algorithm in section 3.1 may be used to generate values for x.  An algorithm
for k and r is given in section 3.2.  The latter algorithm allows most of the
signature computation to be precomputed without knowledge of the message
to be signed.
<p>
The algorithms employ a one-way function G(t,c), where t is 160 bits, c is b
bits (160 ó b ó 512) and G(t,c) is 160 bits.  One way to construct G is via the
Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA), as defined in the Secure Hash Standard (SHS). 
The 160-bit message digest output of the SHA algorithm when message M is
input is denoted by SHA(M).  A second method for constructing G is to use
the
Data Encryption Standard (DES).  The construction of G by these techniques
is discussed in sections 3.3 and 3.4 of this appendix.
<p>
In the algorithms in sections 3.1 and 3.2, a secret b-bit seed-key is used.  The
algorithm in section 3.1 optionally allows the use of a user provided input.  If
G is constructed via the SHA as defined in section 3.3, then b is between 160
and 512.  If DES is used to construct G as defined in section 3.4, then b is
equal
to 160.

Step 3 permits precomputation of the quantities needed to sign the next m
messages.  Step 4 can begin whenever the first of these m messages is ready. 
The execution of step 4 can be suspended whenever the next of the m messages
is not ready.  As soon as steps 4 and 5 have completed, step 3 can be executed,
and the results saved until the first member of the next group of m messages is
ready.
<p>
In addition to space for KKEY, two arrays of length m are needed to store
r<sub><font size=1>0</font></sub> , ... r<sub><font

Storage for s<sub><font size=1>0</font></sub> , ... , s<sup><font
size=1>m-1</font></sup> is only needed if the signatures for a group of
messages are stored; otherwise s<sub><font size=1>j</font></sub> in step 4
can be replaced by s and a single space allocated.

used to detect unauthorized modifications to data and to
authenticate the identity of the signatory.  In addition, the
recipient of signed data can use a digital signature in proving to
a third party that the signature was in fact generated by the
signatory.  This is known as nonrepudiation since the signatory
cannot, at a later time, repudiate the signature.
